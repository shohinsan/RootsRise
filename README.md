# RootsRise

### Overview

RootsRise is an ongoing and collaborative effort to map out the rich history of the Abdulkhamidov family, capturing generations, relationships, and significant milestones. This family tree project aims to create a visual representation of our heritage, fostering a deeper understanding of our roots and the stories that bind us together.
